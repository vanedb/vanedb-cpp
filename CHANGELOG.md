# Changelog

All notable changes to VaneDB will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Project renamed from QuiverDB to VaneDB.** Pre-1.0, so no
  on-disk break — HNSW index files written with the old name still load
  (the `0x51565244` "QVRD" magic is retained for backward compat). What
  *did* change for downstream consumers:
  - C++ namespace: `quiverdb::` → `vanedb::`
  - Python module: `import quiverdb_py` → `import vanedb_py`
  - CMake options: `QUIVERDB_BUILD_*` → `VANEDB_BUILD_*`
  - Preprocessor macros injected by callers (e.g. `-DQUIVER_CUDA_ENABLED`)
    → `-DVANE_CUDA_ENABLED`
  - Logging macros (`QUIVERDB_LOG_*` / `QUIVERDB_LOG_LEVEL_*`) → `VANEDB_LOG_*`
  - Repository: `github.com/tsvet01/quiverdb` → `github.com/tsvet01/vanedb`
    (GitHub redirects the old URL).

### Added
- Comprehensive corruption detection tests for file format validation
  - Invalid magic number, version, metric detection
  - Size overflow protection tests (SIZE_MAX scenarios)
  - Truncated file handling tests
  - Input validation tests (null pointers, invalid parameters)
  - Zero dimension with vectors detection test
  - Combined dim*num_vectors overflow test

### Fixed
- Windows file locking issue in mmap tests (scope store before file removal)
- Type consistency in test file format (uint64_t for dimension field)
- Coverage reporting now excludes test and benchmark files (measures only production code)
- Division by zero in MMapVectorStore when loading corrupted file with dim=0
